            <h4>
            Born from the ashes of Southern California’s millennial metalcore revival, Hopes Ignite fuse raw intensity with cinematic storytelling. Their latest single, “Hollow Vessel,” plunges deep into humanity’s struggle to keep hope alive amid a world in ruin. Now, they’re channeling that same ferocity into their full-length debut—also titled Hollow Vessel—slated for release on vinyl and all major streaming platforms. Packed with thunderous riffs, soaring melodies, and an unwavering love for community, Hopes Ignite transport listeners to a moment lost in time. Keep your eyes peeled for live shows coming soon to a stage near you.
